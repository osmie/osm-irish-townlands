# This is the style file that matches the old version of osm2pgsql, which
# did not make distinctions between tags for nodes and for ways. There are a
# number of optimisations that can be applied here. Firstly, certain tags
# only apply to only nodes or only ways. By fixing this we reduce the amount
# of useless data loaded into the DB, which is a good thing. Possible
# optimisations for the future:

# 1. Generate this file directly from the mapnik XML config, so it's always
# optimal

# 2. Extend it so it can understand that highway=tertiary is for ways and
# highway=bus_stop is for nodes

# Flags field isn't used much yet, expect if it contains the text "polygon"
# it indicates the shape is candidate for the polygon table. In the future I
# would like to be able to add directives like "nocache" which tells
# osm2pgsql that it is unlikely this node will be used by a way and so it
# doesn't need to be stored (eg coastline nodes). While in essence an
# optimisation hack, for --slim mode it doesn't matter if you're wrong, but
# in non-slim you might break something!

# Also possibly an ignore flag, for things like "note" and "source" which
# can simply be deleted. (In slim mode this is, does not apply to non-slim
# obviously)
